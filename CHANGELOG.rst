- Various bug fixes and improvements (#44, #45, #46, #47)

1.0.0 (2017-10-17)
------------------

- This release is replaced with v1.0.1 due to many bugs.

0.9.14 (2017-08-29)
-------------------

**FIX**

- Fix and improve version reference mechanisms.

- Fix missing import error vanished during hostfix cherrypick

0.9.12 (2017-08-29)
-------------------

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- It now applies the same UID to the spawned containers if they have the "uid-match"
  feature label flag. (backported from develop)

0.9.11 (2017-07-19)
-------------------

**FIX**

- Add missing "sorna-common" dependency and update other requirements.

0.9.10 (2017-07-18)
-------------------

**FIX**

- Fix the wrong version range of an optional depedency package "datadog"

0.9.9 (2017-07-18)
------------------

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Improve packaging so that setup.py has the source list of dependencies
  whereas requirements.txt has additional/local versions from exotic
  sources.

- Support exception/event logging with Sentry and runtime statistics with Datadog.

0.9.8 (2017-06-30)
------------------

**FIX**

- Fix interactive user inputs in the batch-mode execution.

0.9.7 (2017-06-29)
------------------

**NEW**

- Add support for the batch-mode API with compiled languages such as
  C/C++/Java/Rust.

- Add support for the file upload API for use with the batch-mode API.
  (up to 20 files per request and 1 MiB per each file)

**CHANGES**

- Only files stored in "/home/work.output" directories of kernel containers
  are auto-uploaded to S3 as downloadable files, as now we rely on our
  dedicated multi-media output interfaces to show plots and other graphics.
  Previously, all non-hidden files in "/home/work" were uploaded.

0.9.6 (2017-04-12)
------------------

- Fix a regression in console output streaming.

0.9.5 (2017-04-07)
------------------

- Add PyTorch support.

- Upgrade aiohttp to v2 and relevant dependencies as well.

0.9.4 (2017-03-19)
------------------

- Update missing long_description.

0.9.3 (2017-03-19)
------------------

- Improve packaging: auto-converted README.md as long description and unified
  requirements.txt and setup.py dependencies.

0.9.2 (2017-03-14)
------------------

- Fix sorna-common requirement version.

0.9.1 (2017-03-14)
------------------

**CHANGES**

- Separate console output formats for API v1 and v2.

- Deprecate unused matching option for execution API.

- Remove control messages in API responses.

0.9.0 (2017-02-27)
------------------

**NEW**

- PUSH/PULL-based kernel interaction protocol to support streaming outputs.
  This enables interactive input functions and streaming outputs for long-running codes,
  and also makes kernel execution more resilient to network failures.
  (ZeroMQ's REQ/REP sockets break the system if any messages get dropped)

0.8.2 (2017-01-16)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Fix a typo that generates errors during GPU kernel initialization.

- Fix regression of '--agent-ip-override' cli option.

0.8.1 (2017-01-10)
------------------

- Minor internal polishing release.

0.8.0 (2017-01-10)
------------------

**CHANGES**

- Bump version to 0.8 to match with sorna-manager and sorna-client.

**FIXES**

- Fix events lost by HTTP connection timeouts when using ``docker.events.run()`` from
  aiodocker.  (It is due to default 5-minute timeout set by aiohttp)

- Correct task cancellation

0.7.5 (2016-12-01)
------------------

**CHANGES**

- Add new aliases for "git" kernel: "git-shell" and "shell"

0.7.4 (2016-12-01)
------------------

**CHANGES**

- Now it uses `aiodocker`_ instead of `docker-py`_ to
  prevent timeouts with many concurrent requests.

  NOTE: You need to run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install the
        non-pip (GitHub) version of aiodocker correctly, before running
        ``pip install sorna-agent``.

**FIXES**

- Fix corner-case exceptions in statistics/heartbeats.

0.7.3 (2016-11-30)
------------------

**CHANGES**

- Increase docker API timeouts.

**FIXES**

- Fix heartbeats stop working after kernel/agent timeouts.

- Fix exception logging in the main server loop.

0.7.2 (2016-11-28)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Hotfix for missing dependency: coloredlogs

0.7.1 (2016-11-27)
------------------

**NEW**

- ``--agent-ip-override`` CLI option to override the IP address of agent
  reported to the manager.

0.7.0 (2016-11-25)
------------------

**NEW**

- Add support for kernel restarts.
  Restarting preserves kernel metadata and its ID, but removes and recreates
  the working volume and the container itself.

- Add ``--debug`` option to the CLI command.

0.6.0 (2016-11-14)
------------------

**NEW**

- Add support for GPU-enabled kernels (using `nvidia-docker plugin`_).
  The kernel images must be built upon nvidia-docker's base Ubuntu images and
  have the label "io.sorna.nvidia.enabled" set ``yes``.

**CHANGES**

- Change the agent to add "lablup/" prefix when creating containers from
  kernel image names, to ease setup and running using the public docker
  repository.  (e.g., "lablup/kernel-python3" instead of "kernel-python3")

- Change the prefix of kernel image labels from "com.lablup.sorna." to
  "io.sorna." for simplicity.

- Increase the default idle timeout to 30 minutes for offline tutorial/workshops.

- Limit the CPU cores available in kernel containers.
  It uses an optional "io.sorna.maxcores" label (default is 1 when not
  specified) to determine the requested number of CPU cores in kernels, with a
  hard limit of 4.

  NOTE: You will still see the full count of CPU cores of the underlying
  system when running ``os.cpu_count()``, ``multiprocessing.cpu_count()`` or
  ``os.sysconf("SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN")`` because the limit is enforced by the CPU
  affinity mask.  To get the correct result, try
  ``len(os.sched_getaffinity(os.getpid()))``.

0.5.0 (2016-11-01)
------------------

**NEW**

- First public release.
