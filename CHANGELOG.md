20.09.5 (2021-02-16)
--------------------

### BREAKING
* You must upgrade manager to 20.09.7+, agent to 20.09.5+, and common to 20.09.4+ altogether at once to make your cluster running correctly!

### Fixes
* Refactor to use the shared `common.events` module to produce agent/kernel/session events to the internal event bus ([#270](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/270))
* Update uvloop to 0.15.1 for better Python 3.8/3.9 support (and drop Python 3.5/3.6 support) ([#271](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/271))


20.09.4 (2021-02-01)
--------------------

### Features

### Fixes
* Fix SSHJ (the SSH client library shipped with IntelliJ/PyCharm IDEs) compatibility issue when sending large files over SFTP ([#265](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/265))
* Update dependencies including pyzmq, pytest, mypy, aioresponses, and python-snappy ([#267](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/267))
* Ensure initialization of the kernel runner even when there are failures during sshd initialization, to prevent indefinite manager hangs ([#268](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/268))
* Fix watcher startup failure after aiotools v1.2 upgrade ([#269](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/269))


20.09.3 (2021-01-20)
--------------------

### Features
* Use the agent's internal unique ID for the socket relay container name to improve multi-agent support ([#259](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/259))
  - **WARNING**: Backend.AI cluster admins should terminate all running sessions, remove the "backendai-socket-relay" container manually, and then restart the agent to upgrade from prior versions.

### Fixes
* Improve daemon shutdown stability using aiotools v1.2 ([#263](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/263))
* Fix indefinite hang of create_kernels() RPC call when there are in-container failures after starting a container but before the kernel runner gets ready ([#264](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/264))


20.09.2 (2021-01-04)
--------------------

### Features
* Allow environment customization by `/opt/container/bootstrap.sh` defined by individual images by sourcing it instead of executing ([#261](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/261))

### Fixes
* Reliable scp support inside container: scp now references correct ssh binary located in /usr/bin/.
  - Force scp to use the specified ssh implementation in Backend.AI ([#260](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/260))


20.09.1 (2020-12-29)
--------------------

### Fixes
* Fix too minimal PATH environment variable when using SSH sessions across different containers in a multi-container session due to the hard-coded default in dropbear ([#258](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/258))


20.09.0 (2020-12-27)
--------------------

### Fixes
* Stabilization of multi-node multi-container support ([#257](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/257))
  - Simplify the Docker Swarm status detection
  - Handle partial failures during batch kernel creation, by reporting the first error, and let successful containers as-is because they will be destroyed by the manager
  - Add suppress-events option to `destroy_kernel()` RPC function to "silenty" destroy kernels for recovery after partial multi-node multi-container session spawn failures


20.09.0rc2 (2020-12-24)
-----------------------

### Fixes
* Fix races of kernel creation events by tracking the creation request IDs ([#256](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/256))


20.09.0rc1 (2020-12-23)
-----------------------

### Features
* Improve multi-node cluster session resource management
  - Apply the even allocator by default for `FractionAllocMap`
  - Add more options to customize allocation strategies to `FractionAllocMap`
  - Allow cusotmization of the quantum size (i.e., base of multiple) of allocation ([#255](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/255))


20.09.0b3 (2020-12-21)
----------------------

### Features
* Add `get_node_hwinfo()` base method for compute plugins for hardware metadata queries.  Currently the intrinsic compute plugins report nothing. ([#253](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/253))


20.09.0b2 (2020-12-20)
----------------------

### Fixes
* Raise the `kernel_started` event by ourselves to fix a race condition of event handling during kernel creation ([#254](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/254))


20.09.0b1 (2020-12-18)
----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* Update `AbstractAllocMap` interface to have explicit per-slot/per-device resource metadata, unifying prior allocmap-sepcific init args, and thus all compute plugins must be updated to instantiate alloc maps properly though the plugin interface itself has not been changed ([#248](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/248))

### Features
* Implement the `UNIQUE` resource slot type and exclusive resource slot checks to support CUDA MIG devices ([#248](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/248))

### Fixes
* Improve statistics collection by applying aiofiles and batching of per-container stat queries ([#248](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/248))
* Change dotfiles' owner inside compute session from root to work. ([#249](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/249))
* Stabilize the container lifecycle monitoring routines to handle missed events for exited containers and keep reconnecting to the docker daemon when actively disconnected ([#250](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/250))
* Update plugin dependencies and now they are installed together with the agent using extra requirements, e.g., `pip install backend.ai-agent[cuda,datadog,sentry]`.  This replaces the manually managed compatibility matrix in each plugin, by ensuring that pip will check the version ranges of plugis. ([#251](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/251))

### Miscellaneous
* Update dependencies and adapt with the new pip resolver ([#247](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/247))
* Reorganize GitHub Actions workflows and drop use of psf-chronographer and Travis CI ([#252](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/252))


20.09.0a5 (2020-12-02)
----------------------

### Features
* Improve compatibility with arbitrary Linux containers by using a statically built Python for kernel-runners compatible with manylinux2010, which eliminates, for instance, OpenSSL dependency in the containers ([#242](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/242))

### Fixes
* Fix a regression to spawning GPU sessions, by passing the original container distribution value (taken from image labels, e.g., `ubuntu16.04`) to compute plugins' `get_hooks()` method instead of the matched result (e.g., `static-gnu`) since the responsibility of choosing the optimal hook binary is on the plugin itself. ([#243](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/243))
* Fix hangs of existing containers which access the agent socket after agent restarts due to the dangling inode, by running a persistent socat container to relay the mounted UNIX sockets and the agent socket bound to a local TCP port ([#244](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/244))
* Let dropbear (intrinsic in-container ssh client) skip checks for the host fingerprints when connecting to other hosts in the same cluster ([#245](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/245))
* Keep the hook filenames consistent to support distributed computing apps such as Horovod that comes with config propagation ([#246](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/246))


20.09.0a4 (2020-11-16)
----------------------

### Fixes
* Fire `execution_started` and `execution_finished` events around the code execution routine to work with the new idle checker framework ([#239](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/239))


20.09.0a3 (2020-11-03)
----------------------

### Fixes
* Fix a critical regression of user-requested app starts due to pre-starting sshd/ttyd services ([#240](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/240))


20.09.0a2 (2020-10-30)
----------------------

### Features

### Fixes
* Update the krunner packages to run kernel runners (in-container daemons) on more recent Python version (3.8.6) and custom build of ttyd to fix periodic disconnection of terminals ([#237](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/237))
* Update broken dependencies (aiohttp~=3.7.0, trafaret~=2.1) ([#238](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/238))


20.09.0a1 (2020-10-06)
----------------------

### Features
* Add support for multi-container sessions ([#164](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/164))
* Add evenly-distributed resource allocator for `AllocMap` instances ([#228](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/228))
* Add a configuration option to allow skipping running manager detection upon agent startup ([#234](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/234))

### Fixes
* Fix a regression of container statistics collection with recent aiodocker versions (0.16 or later) ([#226](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/226))
* Fix missing `allow_extra` options in config input validators, which is a newly exposed regression after ff019ac9 ([#227](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/227))
* Add context parameter for init methods of intrinsic accelerators. ([#229](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/229))
* Fix vfolder mounts for compute sessions using agent host paths provided by the storage proxy ([#231](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/231))
* Allow keypair/group/domain dotfiles to have absolute path from / ([#232](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/232))
* Skip vfolder configuration checks and assume use of storage proxies if the vfolder mount path in etcd is not specified ([#233](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/233))
* Refactor out validation of service port declaration ([#235](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/235))
* Fix a regression of task-log filename by introduction of new environment variables ([#236](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/236))

20.03.0rc1 (2020-07-23)
-----------------------

### Features
* Add support for Ubuntu 20.04 as base-distro for session images
* Allow overriding of intrinsic compute devices (`cpu` and `mem`) using compute device plugins ([#224](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/224))

### Fixes
* Move invocation of user-defined bootstrap script from the container entrypoint to the krunner's main loop for better log visibility and ability to interrupt ([#225](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/225))


20.03.0b2 (2020-07-02)
----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* Apply the plugin API v2 -- all stat/error/accelerator plugins must be updated along with the agent ([#222](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/222))

### Features
* Allow kernel containers to know their identities via `BACKENDAI_KERNEL_ID` environment variable ([#218](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/218))
* Global configuration for agent/container
  - Global configuration on etcd overrides existsing local configuration for agent/container. ([#219](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/219))

### Fixes

* Apply batching when producing "kernel_stat_sync" events to reduce manager loads and increase timeout for caching stats in Redis from 30 seconds to 2 minutes ([#213](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/213))
* Improve stability under heavily loaded scenarios ([#214](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/214))
  - Skip lifecycle sync for already terminating kernels to reduce excessive Docker Engine overheads with a many number of being-terminated kernels
  - Increase timeout for container termination to 60 seconds during restarting kernels, by observing deletion latencies under heavy load tests
* Prevent executing startup command multiple times for batch session. ([#217](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/217))

20.03.0b1 (2020-05-12)
----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* - Now it runs on Python 3.8 or higher only.

### Features
* Now we support ROCM (Radeon Open Compute) accelerators via `backend.ai-accelerator-rocm` plugin.
* Now our manager-to-agent RPC uses [Callosum](https://github.com/lablup/callosum) instead of aiozmq, supporting Python 3.8 natively. ([#157](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/157))
* Support user-defined bootstrap script (e.g., this can be used to clone a git repo) ([#161](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/161))
* ResourceSlots are now more permissive. Agent still checks the validity of known slots but also allows zero-valued unknown slots as well. ([#162](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/162))
* All CLI commands are now accessible via `backend.ai ag` ([#165](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/165))
* Add support for pre-open service ports for user-written apps ([#167](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/167))
* Add a new "app" kernel-runner runtime type for GUI and application-only kernels ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))
* Mark kernel started after bootstrap script is executed ([#190](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/190))
* Generalize kernel-runner volume lists using plugin-like krunner package auto-detection ([#198](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/198))

### Deprecations
* Using CentOS 6.10 as the base distribution for importing images is deprecated. ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))

### Fixes
* Detection for manager now works for HA setup seamlessly. (It now determines if at least one manager is running.) [lablup/backend.ai#125](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/125)
* Fix wrong ownership of .ssh and keypair files when the SSH keypair is set via the `internal_data` field of the kernel creation config.
* Make scratch directory accesses for setup/tear-down fully asynchronous ([#186](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/186))
* Fix service-port parsing routines to recognize "vnc-web" service ports for GUI containers ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))
* Make the kernel runner's service parser consistent with documentation ([#197](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/197))
* Update test fixtures to work with pytest-asyncio 0.11 and use a separate registry state data file for each test sessions ([#208](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/208))
* Update test fixtures to work with pytest-asyncio 0.12 ([#209](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/209))
* Fix lifecycle-related code errors when handling results of batch-mode tasks ([#210](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/210))

### Miscellaneous
* Now the kernel-runner runs on the prebuilt Python 3.8 mounted inside containers. ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))
* Adopt [towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier) to manage changelogs. ([#196](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/196))
* Update flake8 to a prerelease version supporting Python 3.8 syntaxes ([#211](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/211))
